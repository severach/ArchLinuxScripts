# ArchLinuxScripts
This is a haphazard collection of my scripts for Arch Linux.

# zfsbuild.sh,zfsun.sh
These build and uninstall the [zfs](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?K=demizer&SeB=m) tools by demizer when [zfs](http://zfsonlinux.org/) is used as a data drive. I suspect the scripts are useless when zfs is used as a boot drive. Supported are theaded make and downgrades. Arch like distros may also be supported.
